The purpose of this post is to show how easy and intuitive it can be to make a navbar in NextJS with the help of TailwindCSS.

# Setup and Configuration

So, the first thing that we need is install NextJS and tailwindcss. Information captured from [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)

```shell
$npx create-next-app blog_demo
$npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

postcss is the tool that tailwind is going to use to purge unwanted css classes. This helps to drastically reduce the final css of the css

It also used `autoprefixer` tool so that our site can look good across multiple deivices

2. Install tailwindcss configuration files for tailwindcss.config.js as well as postcss.config.js

```shell
$npx tailwindcss init -p
```

`-p` witch specifies to generate `postcss.config.js`.

If we open postcss.config.js, then you can see two plugins specified: tailwindcss and autoprefixer

3. Open your tailwind.config.js and paste the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

content entry specifies where to look for tailwindcss utilities classes. As obviously we'll be using them inside of js/jsx file, we specified those entries.

I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

In 2014, the snowfall was above average.
It was followed by a warm spring which caused
flood <div className='underline inline'>conditions</div> in many of the nearby rivers.

  1. [ ] todo
  2. [x] done

A table:

| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ | :-------------: | ------------: |
| col 3 is      | some wordy text |         $1600 |
| col 2 is      |    centered     |           $12 |
| zebra stripes |    are neat     |            $1 |

We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.

Following example is of `code`.

```cpp filename="myfile.js" hl=2
int main(){
    int x=0;
}
```

```js filename="myfile.js" hl=2,5-8
const Highlighter = (props) => {
  const result = props.linesToHighlight.split(",");
  var linesToHighlight = convertLineStrToArray(props.linesToHighlight);

  console.log(linesToHighlight);
  return (
    <SyntaxHighlighter
      language={props.language}
      lineProps={(lineNumber) => {
        const style = {
          display: "block",
          width: "100%",
        };
        if (linesToHighlight.includes(lineNumber)) {
          style.margin = -16px 2px;
        }
        return { style };
      }}
    >
      {props.children.trim()}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
  );
};
export default Highlighter;
```

<Button text={btn_text} />
<Image
  width={200}
  height={200}
  alt="sds"

/>; ```
