  Here we will be discussing how to interact with slack dialogues. These
  dialogues are very popular among the slack community when it comes to working
  with slack.

This article is in continuation of our last article on [publishing UI messages](/blog/slack-publishing-ui-messages). In the previous article, we discussed how to configure **slack interactivity** and send dialogues to _slack apps_.

Here, we will see how to interact with these dialogues. When we say interact that means how to retrieve and process the information sent from _Slack_ , and how to respond back.

Like **events** and **slash commands** , the payload will be sent to your [configured Request URL](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads) in an HTTP POST.

## Implementing action handlers for buttons

This article is part of: [Most effective way to understand Slack app development](/blog/essential-skills-to-develop-slack-apps)

As we mentioned in the previous article that whenever any action occurs, then [Slack uses action_id to differentiate](/blog/slack-publishing-ui-messages/#slack-block-id-and-action-id) various actions. If you see JSON of the dialogue message, then we specified two `action_id` for our buttons:

```json
...
"type": "actions",
"block_id": "buttons_block",
"elements": [
    {
        ...
        "value": "submit",
        "action_id":"submit_pressed"
    },
    {
        ...
        "action_id":"cancel_pressed",
        "value": "cancel"
    }
]
...
```

Thus we'll add an action handler for these two buttons. Let's open the same
file, which we were working on in the last article: [publish_message.py](https://github.com/pennowtech/slack-app-python-slack-bolt/blob/31853a3b0a49d267b478c62942892df216af2c1a/publish_dialogue.py)

First, we'll implement simple action handlers which we'll simply return with the
text.

```python
@app.action("submit_pressed")
def submit_pressed_handler(ack, say):
    ack()
    say("Submit pressed")


@app.action("cancel_pressed")
def cancel_pressed_handler(ack, say):
    ack()
    say("Cancel pressed")
```

Here, we registered two action handlers as `action_id` mentioned in the JSON
message: `submit_pressed` and `cancel_pressed`. Both handlers just return a
plain text. Try it at your end.

Now, we know how the action handler works. Let's make it a little more interesting.

## Fetch the information from the request body

The next step is to fetch the value of the input text: _URL_ to monitor whenever **submit** is pressed:

```python
from xyz import bc
def extract_input_val(req):
    url_val = None
    frequency_val = None

    # URL input, and frequency selection entries are 4 level deep inside dictionary.
    url_val_dict = dpath.util.get(req, 'state/values/*/sl_input')
    frequency_dict = dpath.util.get(req, 'state/values/*/static_select-action')
    if url_val_dict:
        url_val = url_val_dict.get('value')
    if frequency_dict:
        frequency_dict = frequency_dict.get('selected_option', {}) or {}
        frequency_val = frequency_dict.get('value')

    return url_val, frequency_val
```

**The major change** here is to use `body` parameter of action handler. This
contains the entire body of the request. As we need to extract information out
of the scope of just a button press (input URL), so we have to take its help.

Next, we used **dpath** library to fetch the information from the nested dictionary. Our required entry is 4 levels deep `state/values/url_input_block/sl_input`. Here `url_input_block` is the block id of text input, and `sl_input` is the identifier of the _URL_ input box inside that block. These were the values that we specified in our JSON while composing this dialogue message.

Once entries are found, I returned them back to the caller.

## Handle _Submit_ button

The third step is to process this information and reply back to the sender.

```python
@app.action("submit_pressed")
def submit_pressed_handler(ack, payload, body, say):
    ack()
    url_val_obj = dpath.util.get(body, 'state/values/url_input_block/sl_input')
    if url_val_obj:
        url_val = url_val_obj.get('value')
    say(f'You passed: {url_val}')
```

First I checked that value for `url_val` and `frequency_val` is not empty
inside `verify_input`. Then composed a reply message, and stored that inside
`text`. In the next statement, sent the response back to the app.

Now, run the application again, fill in all the information, and submit it. You should
receive a message such as `You passed [url-enterd]`.

## Add functionality to monitor web URL status

Now, let's add a real feature to our app where it is supposed to test the URL.
It'll be done in two steps:

- First, we'll respond back to the user with the confirmation message on all information he sent.
- Second, we'll implement the function to test the provided URL, and return back a response.

### Respond back with the confirmation message

First, let's formulate a JSON message, which will be sent as acknowledgment.

```json
def URL_monitoring_acknowledgement(url_val):
    response = {
        "attachments": [
            {
                "color": "#f2c744",
                "blocks": [
                    {
                        "type": "section",
                                "text": {
                                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                                    "text": f"Monitoring request received for *{url_val}* :memo: \nChecking ..."
                                }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    return response
```

One thing to notice here is that `blocks` it itself is composed under
`attachments`. I'm using `attachment because of its left-hand colorful border
![monitoring-job-acknowledgement-response](/monitoring-job-acknowledgement-response.png)

Now, let's make a little change inside our _action handler_ to send this response that it has received a request, and soon will reply back with the website status:

```python
@app.action("submit_pressed")
def submit_pressed_handler(ack, payload, body, respond, say):
    ack()
    url_val_obj = dpath.util.get(body, 'state/values/url_input_block/sl_input')
    if url_val_obj:
        url_val = url_val_obj.get('value')
        respond(URL_monitoring_acknowledgement(url_val))
```

Here, I've used another function to `respond()` send the confirmation. I could
use `ack()`. However, I didn't want it to wait till that point. So `respond()`
was a better choice in this context.

### Implement feature to test the website status

This is a _vanilla_ Python implementation. This function will take a web URL
to check its status whether it's up, or server not reachable or bad URL, etc.:

```python hl:5,7,10,12,14-18
async def async_url_check(url):
    err_status = 'Up'
    start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
    try:
        async with aiohttp.request('GET', url, timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=3)) as resp:
            if resp.status >= 400:
                err_status = resp.reason

    except Exception as error:
        err_status = 'Failed {!r}'.format(error)
    finally:
        time_elapsed = round((asyncio.get_running_loop().time() - start), 2)

        msg = {
            'url': url,
            'err_status': err_status if err_status else '-',
            'time': time_elapsed,
        }

        return msg
```

- We're using Python's _asynchronous HTTP_ feature to check the status of the URL(line 5).
- if return status is an error like 404(not found), etc. then it updates the `err_status`(line 7).
- if there is any other like _invalid URL_ , _timeout_ , etc. then it updates those too(line 10).
- next, we calculate the time elapsed to check the URL status(line 12)
- in last, we fill all of this information in a dictionary(line 14-18) and return that back

### Send the URL monitoring status to Slack

Now, we've got the web URL status. We need to send it to Slack. However, we
didn't yet define the message structure to store this information. Let's do
that as an immediate task:

```json
def URL_monitoring_response(msg):
    response = {
        "attachments": [
            {
                "color": "#754324",
                "blocks": [
                        {
                            "type": "context",
                            "elements": [
                            {
                                "type": "mrkdwn",
                                "text": f":spiral_note_pad: Monitoring Report for: {msg['url']}"
                            }
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                        "type": "section",
                        "fields": [
                            {
                                "type": "mrkdwn",
                                "text": f"*Website Status:*\n{msg['err_status']}"
                            },
                            {
                                "type": "mrkdwn",
                                "text": f"*Time taken:*\n{msg['time']}s"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    return response
```

You must be comfortable till now to understand this JSON format. If you still
need any clarification, feel free to ask me through comments. Now, let's fill
this message with the data got from the function `async_url_check` . We'll be
doing this inside our _submit_ button action handler:

```python
@app.action("submit_pressed")
def submit_pressed_handler(ack, payload, body, respond, say):
    ...
    if url_val_obj:
        ...
        response = asyncio.run(async_url_check(url_val))
        say(URL_monitoring_response(response))
```

You must be curious to know why `asyncio.run()`? This is required when we call
an asynchronous function `async def async_url_check()` from inside a non-
asynchronous function (handler function).

The next statement is to pass the
response received from _URL monitoring_ to fill our JSON message, which will
eventually be sent back to Slack.

Now, run your program. Enter the URL to
monitor, and check its status:
![Web-monitoring-status-response](/Web-monitoring-status-response.png)

## Further improvements

Few suggestions which I can give you to explore or practice:

- Display error message if any of the entry isn't filled
- clear the form on pressing the _cancel_ button

These are just some smaller activities, and shouldn't take you long to
implement if you really followed me from the start in this series. Just take
it as your _project assignment_ to test yourself and relearn.

## Summary

Today's article might be a little heavy on you. If that's the case, then I'll
suggest you go through it once again. This would serve as another milestone
before embarking on our journey to our final step.

Let's summarize what all we
discussed in today's article:

- We started our discussion by implementing a simple action handler for our dialogue message
- next, we parsed the information sent along with the button to fetch the URL value
- We added lower-level functionality to check the status of the web URL
- we also touched a little on `attachment` section of JSON message
- At last, we concluded our discussion with further improvement scope.

Next, we'll discuss how to display a _Modal UI_. That's the most interesting
part of our journey. If you followed with me since the beginning, then I can
guarantee you that the next topic will be like a piece of cake for you.

See you later.
