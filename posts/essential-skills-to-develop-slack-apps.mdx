Slack apps in reality are just another kind of message. You can create polls,
raise bugs or service tickets, and many more simply through messages. Of
course, it looks really exciting when we say all of these are possible just
with a messaging app.

Cutting long story short. Here, we will be discussing
how to develop such wonderful apps. We'll cover this in small articles. Each
article will target a single feature, and step by step we will build a full-
fledged application.

    Disclaimer
  </header>

We'll not be discussing the slack app in _general_ such as what it does. However,
if required, I'll also touch on these topics. But our whole discussion will be
from a programming perspective.

</section>

If anyone wants to know how to use slack, then I'll suggest referring [tips and tricks
given by Maggie Tillman](https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/150925-what-is-slack-and-how-does-it-work-tips-tricks).
She explained it all in a very crispy yet concise way.

## What we'll be building

Here, we'll be building an _app_ , which allows you to monitor websites,
create tickets if any issue is faced or the website is down, assigning and
tracking those tickets, etc. If you need more details, jump to the bottom of
this article under the _feature_ section.

> I'll soon be coming with the application mock-ups.

## Technical proficiency requirements

Like other apps, you don't need to learn a new programming language. You can
use any existing programming language with which you're comfortable.

I'll be using Python for our development purpose. It's not only easy to use but also
has a plethora of libraries, which anyone can imagine. So you don't have to
reinvent the wheel. Just concentrate on your work.

Hence the only requirement is: intermediate level of Python proficiency üòä

## Learning Steps

As I mentioned before, we'll be covering or app learning journey in small
steps. I've listed all of the steps here pointing to their respective
articles.

<section className="message header">
  <header>
    <i></i>
    Note
  </header>

We'll be using the _slack_bolt_ library officially released
by Slack. There is another set of libraries named SlackClient. I'll also be
covering that in the future. However, I'll discourage you to use that as
that's deprecated by Slack.

</section>

- [Step.1.](/slack-app-getting-started/) We will walk through setting up our development environment, configuring the slack app, and coding our app in Python.
- [Step.2](/sending-messages-to-slack/). Send a plain text message to Slack or a complex one comprised of multiple sections. Also, discuss how to add our app to a channel.
- [Step.3](/slack-app-with-python-handling-slack-events-part-3/). Listen and react to various events like messages, emojis, and reactions.
- [Step.4](/slack-slash-commands/). Discussion on slash commands, a powerful way to send messages to Slack
- [Step.5](/slack-publishing-ui-messages/). Publishing messages containing elements like buttons, select-menus, date-pickers, and more
- [Step.6](/slack-handling-actions-from-slack-dialogues/). This article is in continuation of the previous article. Here we will be discussing how to handle actions triggered from visual elements such as button clicks or a date selection.
- [Step.7](/slack-app-open-modal-views/). Modal dialogues where messages are displayed in visual blocks elements such as buttons, date picker, etc.
- [Step.8](/slack-app-working-with-shortcuts/). Discussion about message shortcuts and global shortcuts, a convenient way to work with Slack.
- [Step.9](/slack-app-working-with-message-shortcuts/). This article is in continuation of the previous article. Here we‚Äôll discuss message shortcuts.
- Step.10. Publishing your app to Slash App Home.

### Extras

These are just a few add-ons. I just covered them as a reference section here:

- [Scheduling messages to Slack](/scheduling-messages-to-slack/)
- [Pin And Unpin Messages](/slack-app-pin-and-unpin-messages/)
- Test your Slack App
- How to deploy Slack App

The code for this whole tutorial is available on
[Github](https://github.com/pennowtech/slack-app-python-slack-bolt).

> I'll keep on updating this section as I add more and more articles under this series.

## App Features

We'll build an _app_ , which allows one to monitor websites, create tickets if
any issue is faced or the website is down, assigning and tracking those
tickets, etc.

- Create a monitoring job with details such as:
  - **Job identifier** A unique identifier to identify your job (Max length is 20 characters).
  - **Web URL** to monitor.
  - **Search for any string** to make sure that website isn't hacked.
  - **Monitoring Frequency** when the job should run to monitor the website.
  - **Date** from when the job should start monitoring. A use case when the job website isn't ready yet.
- Each time a new job is created, the slack App send back a notification with details of creation:
  - **Job identifier**
  - **Web URL**
  - **Search for the string**
  - **Monitoring Frequency**
  - **Start from [date]**
  - **Next monitoring time**
  - A **_footnote_** with information on who created the job, and when.
- Each created job should automatically be pinned so that easier to access.
- Various **slash commands** such as:
  - `/webmonitor create`: To display the UI to create a new monitoring job.
  - `/webmonitor list`: to list down all web monitor jobs along with their IDs.
  - `/webmonitor kill [job-id]`: To stop the monitoring job without deleting it.
  - `/webmonitor delete [job-id]`: To delete the monitoring job.
  - `/webmonitor run [job-id]`: To run URL monitoring before its scheduled time. Useful while debugging.
  - `/webmonitor list issues`: To list all the issues assigned or unassigned.
  - `/webmonitor close issue [id]`: To close an issue specified by _id._
  - `/webmonitor view issue [id]`: To view an issue specified by _id._
- **Shortcuts** :
  - **To create the job**. Apart from **slash commands** , one can also create a job through _slack_ **shortcuts**
- **Failure Notifications** : Message to be sent whenever an issue is faced with the following information:

  - **Title** : ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert
  - **Job Identifier**
  - **Web URL**
  - **Error Message** such as _connection timed out_ , _string not found(if configured)_ , _website not found_ , _internal server error_ , etc.
  - **Assign to:** To assign the issue to a user to debug and resolve it.

    **Note:** Whenever any issue occurs, it will stop sending further notifications until the website is up again. However, one can run the job manually to check the current status with **/webmonitor run [job-id]** slash command.

- **Success Notification** : Notification to send if web URL is _up_ again. Also, it'll resolve the assigned ticket automatically as well as unpin the _alert_ message raised earlier.
  - **Title** : ‚úîÔ∏è Restored
  - **Job Identifier**
  - **Web URL**
  - **Error Message** : What was the problem reported?
  - **Assigned to:** whom it was assigned
  - Footnote: ‚è∞ Downtime
- **Ticket Operations:**
  - **Create Ticket** Option to create the tickets will only be available from the received alert. Fields will be:
    - **#id** : A number assigned automatically. Displayed at the top.
    - **Assignee** : Whom to assign from the team
    - **Planned date** (optional): Till when to fix the issue
    - **Extra Details(optional)** : Any detail which could be supportive.
- `/webmonitor close issue [id]`: Apart from closing automatically when the website is up; one can also close it manually. The only information to fill in is **Closing details** such as what was the problem, how was it resolved, or just to drop the idea to fix the issue for whatsoever reason.
- `/webmonitor view issue [id]`: View the ticket details. Here, you can also edit the issue, like any change in assignee, date or details, etc. The last 2 changes and one from creation time will be displayed as history at bottom of the window. To view complete history no option planned as yet.

## Final Words

I'm really excited to discuss my learning with you guys. I hope I'll be able
to convey my thoughts in a clear and concise way. At the same time, I'll also
expect your valuable feedback on whatever we discuss. It'll help me to improve
the quality of my articles.

If you've any questions, please feel free to let me know through your comments.

Now let's start our journey ‚òïÔ∏è
