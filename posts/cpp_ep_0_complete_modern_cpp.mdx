C++ is one of the pouplar languages since its inception. Program written in it are not only faster but also more efficient. You can say it is one of the very few languages that is suited for both object-oriented as well as functional programming.

In this article series, we are going to cover almost all of the features of modern C++ whether it's C++11, C++14, C++17 or C++20. It can be variables, templates, strings, containers, algorithms, iterators, variadic templates, smart pointers, streams, regular expressions, threads, filesystem, atomic operations, utilities, range, and many more.

However, we will not be discussing the very basic constructs such as how to write a program or compile it. Probably in future, I might be tempted to write an article on these topics if you would like to.

## Target Audience ü•∑

I hope this series would be useful to beginners as well as advanced level of developers. In my experience, I've seen people who still face a lot of problem in using modern C++ constructs properly. Hence, this would be my small effort to make those constructs easier to understand and apply.

Even experienced developers will find many topics that can come in handy in time of need.

## Code Sharing

I'll be sharing the code through _github_. You can download from there and try on your system. However, I'd encourage you to write all the code samples by yourself. It would really help you to learn faster.

## System Requirements üèóÔ∏è

In order to compile all the programs, I'd be using _Windows Subsystems for Linux_. But you can also compile your code on Windows, Mac, Unix or any other Linux based distros.

On Windows, Visual Studio C++ is the preferred option. On others, you can use _gcc_ or _clang_ compiler to compile your programs. If you don't have it installed on your system, then you can refer to the following link to setup your environment.

- [Download Visual Studio Community for Windows](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Install the C++ compiler on Ubuntu](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-g-the-c-compiler-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa-linux)

Many online compilers are also available, which can help you to start quickly. My personal choice in this situation is to go for [online gdb]([Online C++ Compiler - online editor (onlinegdb.com)](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)) compiler.
