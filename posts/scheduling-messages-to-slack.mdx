<p className="italic font-semibold">
  Scheduling a massage can help one to reduce the number of missed appointments.
  You can **schedule** messages programmatically also.

The agenda of this discussion is how to send the messages at some particular
time instead of immediately. For example, if I want to send a message after 20
seconds, then how can I do that. That's really simple. Let's see how to do
that.

This article is part of: [Most effective way to understand Slack app
development](https://pennow.tech/essential-skills-to-develop-slack-apps/)

\_\_Reference In case, you are new to Slack app development, I will advise you
to go through our article on [getting started with
Slack](https://pennow.tech/slack-app-getting-started/). This will help you to
quickly come to the level where you can understand our current discussion.

## Schedule a message to _Slack_

\*Slack provides us with a very nice _API_ : `chat.scheduleMessage`. Firstly, include all of the required dependencies, and initialize _slack client_ with the help of `SLACK_API_TOKEN`.

    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from slack import WebClient
    import datetime

    load_dotenv()

    SLACK_API_TOKEN = token = os.environ['SLACK_API_TOKEN']

    slack_client = WebClient(SLACK_API_TOKEN)

Now with the help of `datetime` module, we can get the required time after 40
seconds:

    scheduled_time = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(seconds=20)

Use this time to schedule your message:

        slack_client.chat_scheduleMessage(
            channel='#web-monitor',
            post_at=scheduled_time.timestamp(),
            text="Scheduled Message: Hello"
        )

`channel` is the name of the channel where you want to send the message.
`post_at` specifies the time when this message should be sent to _slack app_
`text` is any message which you want to send. This could be plain text or a
JSON message. Now run the program, and you should receive the message after 40
seconds. Even your program returned immediately, still, you'll get the
message. This is how scheduling works. We can also schedule a message for
_days, months, years, etc_.

### Scheduling at some particular fixed time

If you want to schedule a message at some particular time, then that is also
very easy to achieve. Say, if you want to schedule your massage at _10pm_ on
_02/05/2021_ :

    scheduled_time = datetime.datetime(2021, 5, 2, 10, 0).timestamp()

The rest of the code will remain as before.

## Summary

So we say how to schedule a message. You can set your schedule time after a
few seconds, days or months. Not just this, but you can also schedule your
message at some fixed time in the future. Source [shcedule_message.py
