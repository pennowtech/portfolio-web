I know I told you that this is not a beginner level course. 💡 Hence, you might already know how to write a C++ program. However, let's respect our _Hello World_ program. 😀

Let's wtite a bare minimal program. As you might have guessed, it's our good-old "Hello World" program.

At this stage, we're not concerned much of the syntax. Just, let's write our first C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
	//print Hello World on the console
	std::cout<<"Hello World.\n";
	return 0;
}
```

- First statement is a directive to include any dependencies. We're including `iostream`, which is a part of the standard library. Here, we need it to print our statement on the console. `std::cout` is coming out from there.
- second statement is a way of defining a function. Any C++ program must have defined a `main()` function. It's the entry point of your program.
- third staement is a comment intended for a person, reading your code
- `std::cout` statement prints the string `Hello World` on the console.
- last statement is to _return_ any value from your function. But as this is the _main_ function invoked by system, so here it will be running _exit status_ of your program. `0` means program was successful.
  **Note:** All statement needs to end with `;`

## Build and Run ⚙️

I hope your system is ready to compile and run any C++ program. If not, then you can refer to my previous article or video on the various options available with you.

I'll be using `g++` compiler. There is not any particular reason to use it. Only thing is that I'm using it since start of my carrer.

```shell
$g++ main.cpp -o hello_world
```

Here, we're passing our `main.cpp` file as input. `-o` specifies the name of the executable/binary, which in our case is `hello_world`. If you don't specify it, then it will be creating your binary wiith the name of `a.out`.

Let's run this program now:

```cpp
$./hello_world
#Output
Hello World
```

This was a very basic program to get us start with our C++ journey. But real life journey is not so simple. Hence, in next parts we would be discussing many fundamental and advanced constructs to develop our understanding about C++.
