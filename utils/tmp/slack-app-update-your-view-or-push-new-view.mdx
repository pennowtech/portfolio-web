title: 'Slack App with Python: Update your view or Push new View [Extra]'
---

We've already discussed modal views in detail. I'd strongly recommend you to
go through my article on [Working with Slack modal
views](https://pennow.tech/slack-app-open-modal-views/). This article is a
supplement to that article.

Now one can ask me why I put in _extra_. The answer is that I didn't require
this feature for the product which we're developing in that series of
articles. Here we'll be discussing two subsections of modal views:

  * one is how to update the existing view
  * second is how to push a new view

Then. let's start with updating views. **Disclaimer** : Examples given might
not fit into the practical world. However, my only perspective of writing this
article is to give an overview of how `views.update()` and `views.push()`
works. So let's concentrate on that part only.

## Update Views

Suppose this is our current view where a user is looking for information on an
employee. [caption id="attachment_1516" align="aligncenter"
width="639"]![Slack-Actual-Modal-View](https://pennow.tech/wp-
content/uploads/2021/05/Slack-Actual-Modal-View.png) Slack Actual Modal
View[/caption] However, while entering the department name, he realizes that
he **_doesn't know the exact name_** of the departments. He needs some hints.
So he needs some way to fetch the department's list. He'd prefer it should be
on the same page instead of *closing * the view, and open another view to
fetch the list, then come back here again. It'd be a tedious task. So we'll
help him by providing him with an extra button. He can click on that button,
and our department input box will be replaced with a selection box. So we'll
be designing two forms. But the user will feel as there is only one. ðŸ˜„

This article is part of: [Most effective way to understand Slack app
development](https://pennow.tech/essential-skills-to-develop-slack-apps/).

The first form will be normal form as above with the addition of a button:
[caption id="attachment_1517" align="aligncenter" width="642"]![updated-
sketch-employee-form](https://pennow.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/updated-
sketch-employee-form.png) Updated sketch employee form[/caption] Seconds form
is with the option to select from a list. This form will be presented only
when the user clicks on the **Click Me** button on the first. As this form
will be replacing the existing form, so this is a use case of _updating modal
views_. [caption id="attachment_1515" align="aligncenter"
width="643"]![employee-form-select-department](https://pennow.tech/wp-
content/uploads/2021/05/employee-form-select-department.png) an employee from
select department[/caption] Now, cutting long story short, let's start with
the implementation.  __Important Again, I'd strongly recommend you to go
through my article on [Working with Slack modal
views](https://pennow.tech/slack-app-open-modal-views/) before proceeding
further. Otherwise, this article will be too difficult to understand.

### Design modal views

With the help of [Slack Builder Kit](https://pennow.tech/slack-publishing-ui-
messages/#Brief_Overview_of_Slack_Block_Kit_Builder), let's design the UIs for
both views. We'll store JSON of the first view inside a function
`employee_view()` :

    
    
    def employee_view():
        return ({
    	"type": "modal",
    	"callback_id": "employee_view",
    	"title": {
    		"type": "plain_text",
    		"text": "Employee information"
    	},
    	"submit": {
    		"type": "plain_text",
    		"text": "Submit"
    	},
    	"blocks": [
    		{
    			"type": "input",
    			"block_id": "name_input_block",
    			"element": {
    				"type": "plain_text_input",
    				"action_id": "name_input",
    				"placeholder": {
    					"type": "plain_text",
    					"text": "Enter employee's name"
    				}
    			},
    			"label": {
    				"type": "plain_text",
    				"text": "Name"
    			}
    		},
    		{
    			"type": "input",
    			"element": {
    				"type": "plain_text_input",
    				"action_id": "plain_text_input-action",
    				"placeholder": {
    					"type": "plain_text",
    					"text": "Enter employee's department"
    				}
    			},
    			"label": {
    				"type": "plain_text",
    				"text": "Department",
    				"emoji": True
    			}
    		},
    		{
    			"type": "section",
    			"text": {
    				"type": "mrkdwn",
    				"text": "If you want to select from department list:"
    			},
    			"accessory": {
    				"type": "button",
    				"text": {
    					"type": "plain_text",
    					"text": "Click Me",
    					"emoji": True
    				},
    				"value": "click_me_123",
    				"action_id": "button-action"
    			}
    		}
    	]
    }) 
    

and store JSON of second view inside `employee_view_with_department_list()`:

    
    
    def employee_view_with_department_list():
        return ({
    	"type": "modal",
    	"callback_id": "employee_view_with_department_list",
    	"title": {
    		"type": "plain_text",
    		"text": "Employee information"
    	},
    	"submit": {
    		"type": "plain_text",
    		"text": "Submit"
    	},
    	"blocks": [
    		{
    			"type": "input",
    			"block_id": "name_input_block",
    			"element": {
    				"type": "plain_text_input",
    				"action_id": "name_input",
    				"placeholder": {
    					"type": "plain_text",
    					"text": "Enter employee's name"
    				}
    			},
    			"label": {
    				"type": "plain_text",
    				"text": "Name"
    			}
    		},
    		{
    			"type": "input",
    			"block_id": "department_select_block",
    			"element": {
    				"type": "static_select",
    				"placeholder": {
    					"type": "plain_text",
    					"text": "Select an item",
    					"emoji": True
    				},
    				"options": [
    					{
    						"text": {
    							"type": "plain_text",
    							"text": "Electrical",
    							"emoji": True
    						},
    						"value": "electrical"
    					},
    					{
    						"text": {
    							"type": "plain_text",
    							"text": "Management",
    							"emoji": True
    						},
    						"value": "management"
    					},
    					{
    						"text": {
    							"type": "plain_text",
    							"text": "Mechanical",
    							"emoji": True
    						},
    						"value": "mechanical"
    					}
    				],
    				"action_id": "department_select_action"
    			},
    			"label": {
    				"type": "plain_text",
    				"text": "Department",
    				"emoji": True
    			}
    		}
    	]
    })
    

### Implementing command handler

The first step is to decide how to display the first view. Either you can use
a _slash command handler_ or you can implement a _shortcut_. Both approaches
are fine. Let's go with the command handler. If you don't know then you can
refer to my article on how to implement [slack command
handlers](https://pennow.tech/slack-slash-commands/)

    
    
    @app.command("/employee")
    def employee_command_handler(ack, payload, client):
        ack()
    
        res = client.views_open(
            trigger_id=payload["trigger_id"],
            view=job_create_view()
        )
    

Now, the user will be presented with a view. However, the **Click Me** button
will not work yet. Therefore, implement a handler for this button. This button
is supposed to return the second form. Let's do it:

    
    
    @app.action("button-action")
    def update_employee_view(ack, body, client, respond):
        ack()
        view_info = employee_view_with_department_list()
    
        client.views_update(
            view_id=body["view"]["id"],
            hash=body["view"]["hash"],
            view=view_info
        )
    

Here, we're using `views_update()` method to update the existing view.
However, if you want to update an existing view, you'll need a _view id_ of
that. This we fetched from the body of the message passed to our handler
function. _The second parameter_ is hash that's required to avoid race
conditions. If you don't know about it, then refer to Slack's documentation.
_the third parameter_ is our new view with which we want to replace the
existing view. Note: Updating a view is only possible when the event is
triggered through actionable components such as button, select-box, etc. Now,
run your program, and it'll present you with the first form. Click on the
**Click Me** button there, and you'll be presented with another form,
replacing the first one.

### Retain old form's information

Suppose, you already entered the employee's name, and want to retain this
information in the new form, then that's also possible with a little change.
First, retrieve the value from the old form before presenting a new form/view.
Then pass this value to the function which is returning JSON of the new view:

    
    
    @app.action("button-action")
    def update_employee_view(ack, body, client, respond):
        ack()
        employee_name = body['view']['state']['values']['name_input_block']['name_input']['value']
        view_info = employee_view_with_department_list(employee_name)
    

Secondly, modify the JSON of your second form to fill in this information as
`initial_value`:

    
    
    def employee_view_with_department_list(employee_name):
        return ({
    	...
    	"blocks": [
    		{
    			"type": "input",
    			"block_id": "name_input_block",
    			"element": {
    				"type": "plain_text_input",
    				"action_id": "name_input",
    				"initial_value": employee_name if employee_name else "",
    				"placeholder": {
    					"type": "plain_text",
    					"text": "Enter employee's name"
    				}
    			},
                ...
    
    

Rest whole of the message will remain as before. Now run your program again,
and it should work as expected.

### Handling view submission

We need to handle the view submission of both forms. Both forms have different
`callback_id`. So that's easy to distinguish which form was submitted. I'll
add here for the second form. You'll try for the first form. My view
submission is too simple. It just fetches the values from the submitted form
and prints the result on your terminal:

    
    
    @app.view('employee_view_with_department_list')
    def employee_view_submission(ack, say, respond, client, body):
        ack()
        employee_name = body['view']['state']['values']['name_input_block']['name_input']['value']
        employee_deptt = body['view']['state']['values']['department_select_block']['department_select_action']['selected_option']['value']
    
        text=(f"Employee name: {employee_name}. "
              f"Employee department: {employee_deptt}")
        print(text)
    
    

## Push views

Another feature supported by view is to push another view over the first view.
Unlike _update_ , it doesn't replace the existing view. However, on top of
that, it'll display another view. When you submit/cancel the latest view, it
returns to the existing view. We can use the same views/forms which we
designed for our update view discussion. As I told you before, my perspective
here is not to present any logical design but to explain how _push_ and
_update_ feature works.

### Implementation

Let's use the same command to display the first form as we're doing in update
views. Now coming to pushing the new view. Then there is a little change. Now
instead of calling `views_update()`, we'll be calling `views_push()` method.
The arguments expected by it are the same as we're in the case of
`views_open()`. So let's implement our second view handler:

    
    
    @app.action("button-action")
    def update_employee_view(ack, body, client, respond):
        ack()
        employee_name = body['view']['state']['values']['name_input_block']['name_input']['value']
        view_info = employee_view_with_department_list(employee_name)
    
        client.views_push(
            trigger_id=body["trigger_id"],
            view=view_info
        )
    
    

Now, run your app, and get yourself the feel of how _push_ modal works.

## Summary

As mentioned at the beginning of this article is a supplement to our existing
article on Slack modal views. Here, we discussed two other features of Slack
modal views. One was how to update the existing displayed form. The second one
was to discuss how to push a new form over the existing one without replacing
it. Some guys find these concepts a little difficult to understand in the
beginning. Even I'd struggled during my time. That's why I thought to write on
these topics. [wpdiscuz-feedback id="6n9ru1ydde" question="Please leave a
feedback on this" opened="0"][/wpdiscuz-feedback] Hope it can help you guys.
